<h2>Qlik Sense Current Selections Text Box</h2>
<br>
<br>
A very simple Qlik Sense extension that allows users to show the selections currently set in an application. This has been requested for use cases where exporting / printing a sheet or story to PDF or Powerpoint and the selections are required to be shown.

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
There are no instructions, simply drag the 'Current Selections' object onto your sheet and give it a Title as you require.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Testing</h3>
Tested with Qlik Sense 2.2.3<br>
Note: At the time of testing extensions do not print to PDF or PowerPoint and appear as invalid object areas. This will hopefully be addressed soon to allow the fulll fuctionality of export sheets and stories to be available across extensions.
